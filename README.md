# MonoAlphabeticCypher
The MonoAlphabetic cypher is a cypher in which we can encrypt some Plain text i.e, a message.
The working behind a monoalphabetic cypher is, every alphabet is assigned to a random alphabet. 
For example, a is assigned to d, b is assigned to y, and so on to the end of the alphabets.
After assigning, the end result of the allocation, is what we call KEY
The problem with this cypher is, if the KEY is leaked, the attacker would always be able to understand the encrypted text.

The monoalphabetic cypher I made, is using simple c++ code, in which i have randomly assigned every alphabet to other alphabet.
I have made two programs, one for encryption, and other for decryption.
